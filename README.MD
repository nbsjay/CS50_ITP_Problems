# CS50 INTRODUCTION TO PYTHON

## Intro
CS50's introduction to python is an introductory course to computer science using the programming language python. In this repository,
I've created python files in which I solve the problems assigned by the tutor.

## Modules
The modules covered in this course are:
- Functions, Variables
- Conditionals
- Loops
- Exceptions
- Libraries
- Unit Tests
- File I/O
- Regular Expressions
- Object-Oriented Programming

These are indexed starting from 0. Solutions to the problems will be in folders bearing their respective module name.
There may be files named 'test.py'; I used these to test and troubleshoot my code before implementing them in the main files
